This repo is an archive of a project done in 2019 as a student.

The target platform is an ESP8266, with some required lib MQTT and SSL.

The memory map is detailedin IOTProtect.h

/!\ DO NOT USE THE SSL CERTIFIATE PROVIDED AS SAMPLE

Note : 

       SSL is disabled, due perfomances.
       Also, SSL is a bit overkill for a project like this.
